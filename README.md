## Artist’s Statement

### Bridges: the abridged version
A literal take on the theme “Bridging the Gap”, this series is a technology-art fusion on bridges. Bridges have been used for thousands of years to join two locations. 
In this work, we join art and technology, creating this series using artificial intelligence. Not only are we bridging the gap between art and technology, but we are also 
bridging the gap between our own human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is often portrayed as cold and mechanical. In this work, I hope to 
portray the beauty and complexity of artificial intelligence and convince the viewer of the emotion that can be induced by this technology. 
The neural transfer model used in this work is available at [link to github].
